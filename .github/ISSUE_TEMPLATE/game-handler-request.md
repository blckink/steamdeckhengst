**Controller support**
Does the game have native controller support? If not, is there a mod for the game that adds controller support? Specify that here. Do note that PartyDeck is a controller-only app for now, so any game that only supports keyboard and mouse for input will not work.

**PCGamingWiki Article**
Search your game on PCGamingWiki, and put a link to the article here. PCGW articles contain lots of info that help a lot with handler creation.

**Steam**
Is your game on Steam? If so, put a link to the SteamDB page for your game here. If you're aware that the game uses Steamworks DRM, also specify that here.

**Additional info**
If there's any extra info that you think would assist in the creation of a handler for this game, put it here.
