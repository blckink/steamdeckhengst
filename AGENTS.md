# AGENT Instructions

This file defines guidelines for Codex agents working on this repository.

- **Formatting**: Run `cargo fmt` before committing changes to Rust code. The codebase uses four-space indentation.
- **Testing policy**: Run tests or `cargo build` only when making significant changes (e.g., modifying multiple modules or more than ~20 lines). For small fixes or tweaks affecting only a few lines, you may skip test runs.
- **Commit messages**: Use short, present-tense summaries in English.
